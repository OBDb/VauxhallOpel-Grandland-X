    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Grandland X was introduced as the largest crossover SUV in the manufacturer's lineup, replacing the Antara and competing in the crowded compact SUV segment. Developed following PSA Group's acquisition of Vauxhall/Opel from General Motors, the Grandland X was based on the PSA EMP2 platform shared with the Peugeot 3008, representing one of the first new models launched under PSA ownership. Featuring relatively conventional SUV styling with a high beltline, pronounced wheel arches, and contrasting roof options, the Grandland X prioritized mainstream appeal over distinctive design flourishes. Engine options included PSA-sourced petrol and diesel units, with the petrol lineup featuring a 1.2-liter turbocharged three-cylinder producing 130 horsepower and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 180 horsepower, while diesel options comprised 1.5 and 2.0-liter four-cylinders with outputs ranging from 120 to 177 horsepower. In 2019, a plug-in hybrid variant was introduced, combining a 1.6-liter petrol engine with electric motors for either 225 horsepower in front-wheel drive form or 300 horsepower with all-wheel drive capability through an additional rear electric motor. Transmission choices included six-speed manual and eight-speed automatic options. The interior featured a driver-oriented cockpit with a standard 7-inch or optional 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, traditional analog instruments, and a straightforward control layout. Practical features included generous passenger space, up to 514 liters of cargo capacity, and numerous storage compartments throughout the cabin. Safety technology was comprehensive with available features including adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, blind spot monitoring, and automated parking assistance. The Grandland X represented Vauxhall/Opel's entry into the highly competitive compact SUV segment, offering a balance of practicality, technology, and moderate styling that appealed to mainstream buyers seeking a versatile family vehicle."

    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Grandland (dropping the 'X' suffix from its name) received a substantial facelift for the 2022 model year, adopting the brand's new 'Vizor' front end design—a blacked-out panel spanning the width of the vehicle integrating headlights and brand logo—creating a much more distinctive and modern appearance than its predecessor. Beyond the dramatically redesigned front end, the updated Grandland featured revised rear styling with darkened taillight surrounds, new wheel designs, and enhanced trim options including a more dynamic GSe electrified performance variant. The engine lineup continued with the same range of petrol, diesel, and plug-in hybrid powertrains, though with minor efficiency improvements to meet evolving emissions standards. The most significant interior update was the introduction of the Pure Panel digital cockpit combining a 12-inch digital instrument cluster with a 10-inch central touchscreen under a single curved housing, creating a more high-tech, contemporary ambiance. Additional technology improvements included the availability of Night Vision (a segment first), 360-degree parking cameras, and enhanced driver assistance systems. The plug-in hybrid variants remained a key part of the lineup, offering up to 39 miles of electric-only range (WLTP) and serving as a stepping stone in the brand's electrification strategy. Under full Stellantis ownership (following the merger of PSA Group and FCA), the refreshed Grandland continued as Vauxhall/Opel's flagship SUV, appealing to family buyers seeking a practical, technology-rich crossover with distinctive styling and the option of electrified powertrains, while facing the challenge of standing out in one of the most crowded and competitive segments of the European market."
